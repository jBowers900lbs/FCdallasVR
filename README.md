Unity - Do this first for new projects!
Create a new project (or edit an existing one)
Go to Edit>Project Settings>Editor
Change Version Control to Visible Meta Files
Change Asset Serialization to Force Text


HOW TO USE THE GITHUB: DO NOT FORK ANYTHING EVER; ONLY BRANCH
Setup (THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE IF YOU HAVE NO WORKING PROJECT ON YOUR MACHINE) 1. In a browser, navigate to the repository 2. Click the dropdown menu to select a branch and create a new branch with the name "FirstInitialLastName" (If youâ€™re working from multiple machines, label them, mine would be jBowers_workComp) 3. This branch will be the only area you work on; no one should be working on the raw master branch 4. Download the GitHub Desktop Application 5. Switch your active branch to the branch you made online
Setup (USE THIS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A WORKING PROJECT BUT HAVE NOT ACCESSED THE REPO BEFORE) 1. Follow all of the original setup instructions 2. Find your local branch repo in the File Explorer 3. Delete everything from that folder 4. Move the Assets and Project Settings subfolders of your working project into this folder, wrapped inside a folder with the same name as the project 5. Skip to the "Updating Your Branch" section of this README
Beginning To Work (THIS MUST BE DONE EVERY TIME YOU GO TO WORK ON THE PROJECT) 1. Make sure your local master copy is updated by selecting it as the active branch and clicking Sync (GitHub Desktop Application) 2. Switch your active branch back to your personal branch 3. Before you start working on your branch, click the Update From Master button to make sure you have the most up-to-date project 4. Click Sync to update your remote branch 5. Work on whatever it is you need to work on
Updating Your Branch 1. After working, when you go back to the Desktop Application, there should be a list of changes 2. Make sure you have your branch selected (it's next to the branch icon) 3. Create a title (summary) and a description of all the changes you made to the project 4. Click the commit button
Updating The Master (THIS SHOULD BE DONE AFTER FINISHING ANY WORK) 1. Make sure your local master copy is updated by selecting it as the active branch and clicking Sync (GitHub Desktop Application) 2. Switch your active branch back to your personal branch 3. To make sure nothing changed while you worked, click Update From Master 4. Once that's done, click Sync to finish updating your branch (this does not affect the files you worked on) 5. Once you've updated your branch, click the Pull Request button (top right) 6. Make sure it is set to "from (your branch) into master" 7. Add a title and description, same as when you committed changes to your branch 8. Click Send Pull Request 9. An admin will approve the request and the master copy will be updated with your changes
Ensuring Your Branch is Up-to-Date If at any time you are unsure if you're working in the most up-to-date project, follow these instructions 1. Make sure your local master copy is updated by selecting it as the active branch and clicking Sync (GitHub Desktop Application) 2. Switch your active branch back to your personal branch 3. Click Update From Master 4. Click Sync If you are still unsure, check the networking graph and commit history on the Github website


WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS (fails to sync or pull)
Copy your project to somewhere else
Delete your local project folder
Clone again from MASTER
Drag and drop your project back in and replace everything
